## Lea's group

## Jaap's group

## Piek's group

In this project we aim to develop several complementary thought selection methods based on RL, NSP, paragraph-similarity and corpus statistics in order to improve the dialogue capabilities of the Leolani robot in terms of coherence and learning ability.

The implementation can be found in `./think_aloud/`
